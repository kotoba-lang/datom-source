(ns run-tests
  "Run the whole portable suite under nbb (ClojureScript on Node via SCI).

  This library is pure .cljc and is the sole runtime dependency of
  kotoba-lang/datalog, and the runtime that actually ships is the cljs one
  (the object-store and D1 workers are Cloudflare Workers). Its only fleet
  gate was :jvm-test, so the half that ships was the half nobody ran.

  Running it found six real defects, all one shape: host field access on a
  defrecord. (.-answers v) reads a Java field on the JVM but is undefined
  under SCI, so every function that reached for a record field this way threw
  'No protocol method IDeref.-deref defined for type undefined'. counts,
  absorb, coverage, cache-stats and adjacency/stats were all affected -- that
  is the public read side of counting, view and cached. They now use keyword
  access, which is correct on both runtimes.

  Measured 2026-08-20, after that fix, the two runtimes agree exactly:

    clojure -M:test        Ran 23 tests containing 74 assertions, 0 failures
    nbb run-tests.cljs         23 tests containing 74 assertions, 0 failures

  Every namespace is listed explicitly, and the list is the point. There was
  already a cljs entry point here (test/datom/cljs_runner.cljc) but it named
  three of the four test namespaces; kotobase.datom-plan-test was absent, so
  it ran 21 tests where the JVM ran 23 and nothing reported the difference.
  clojure -M:test finds namespaces by scanning test/, a cljs runner cannot,
  and a namespace left off a cljs runner does not fail -- it silently never
  runs.
