  "The seam every kotobase query path plugs into.

  kotobase's query namespaces (`arrangement.query`, `arrangement.datalog/q`)
  take a MATERIALIZED db — a map of four in-memory indices. That one choice
  fixes the cost of every query at O(database) rather than O(result), because
  producing the db means reading the whole index tree first. Measured on
  `arrangement` (2026-08-01): 57ms/50 block-reads at 2k facts, 678ms/640 at
  32k, linear in the size of the DATABASE regardless of how few rows come
  back.

  Rewriting that in place would mean deciding, once and for all, which of
  several strategies is right — cursor scans, compaction over partitions,
  precomputed views, adjacency indexes — before any of them has been measured
  against the others. This namespace exists so that decision does not have to
  be made in advance.

  A **pattern source** answers exactly one question: given `[s p o]` with nil
  for wildcard, which quads match? Everything else — how the index is stored,
  whether it is one tree or two hundred, whether the answer was precomputed —
  is behind that. Sources compose: `merged` turns k of them into one, so a
  partitioned root is just a merge of its partitions, and a compacted root is
  the same source after folding. Implementations live in whichever library
  owns the storage they read; this library owns only the contract, the
  combinators, and — the part that makes the pieces interchangeable rather
  than merely similar — the CONFORMANCE SUITE every implementation must pass.

  Deliberately zero dependencies. A seam that drags a storage engine in with
  it is not a seam."
