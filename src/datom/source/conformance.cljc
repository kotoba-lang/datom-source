  "The suite every IPatternSource implementation must pass.

  This is the part that makes the pieces interchangeable rather than merely
  similar. Without it, `cursor` and `materialized` are two things that both
  have a `-scan` method and probably agree; with it, they are two things that
  have been CHECKED to answer identically over a corpus designed to catch the
  ways index layouts differ — wildcards in every position, values that repeat
  across subjects, subjects that repeat across predicates, absent terms.

  Deliberately NOT a set of `deftest`s. A conformance suite that requires the
  implementing repo to adopt this repo's test framework, runner and platform
  conditionals is a dependency, not a contract. `check` returns data; each
  repo spends one `deftest` on it."
