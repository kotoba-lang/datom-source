  "Run the portable suite under a real ClojureScript host (cljs.main --target
  node).

  `datom.source` is `.cljc` and is the sole runtime dependency of
  `kotoba-lang/datalog`, but nothing in this repo had ever run it under
  ClojureScript -- there was no CI here at all. That matters more than usual
  in this fleet: the recurring defect this month has been `.cljc` whose cljs
  half is broken while the JVM half is green, and the runtime that actually
  ships is the cljs one (the object-store and D1 workers are Cloudflare
  Workers). A portability claim no machine checks is a claim.

    clojure -Sdeps '{:paths [\"src\" \"test\"]}' -M:cljs \\
      -m cljs.main --target node --output-dir target/node-out \\
      --output-to target/tests.cjs -c datom.cljs-runner
    echo '{\"type\":\"commonjs\"}' > target/node-out/package.json
    node target/tests.cjs

  EXIT CODE. The two-step above is not decoration. `cljs.main ... -m
  <this-ns>` evaluates -main inside a node REPL environment, and the
  process a caller waits on -- the driver -- exits 0 no matter what the
  tests did, so the `js/process.exitCode` this file sets below never
  reaches anyone. Measured 2026-08-25 in cloud-itonami-isic-6492, both
  directions: the -m form printed `1 failures` and exited 0 with an
  assertion deliberately broken; the compiled bundle printed
  `1 failures` and exited 1 for the same break, including when the
  break lands inside an async callback after run-tests has returned.
  `js/process.exit` is not an escape either -- it hangs the driver.

  The package.json line is load-bearing: these repos declare
  `\"type\": \"module\"`, which makes node read Closure's emitted .js as
  ESM and die on `require`. The marker scopes target/node-out back to
  CommonJS."
